CSCI 1170 Assignment 3

Description:
This is the last assignment for CSCI 1170, where I combined some new JS features 
with my original professional website work from A1 and A2. (I REUSED THE CODE FROM ASSIGNMENT 2)

The file struture:

        2.js
        style1.css
        style2.css
        style3.css

Some important JS features:
1. In lines 4 to 16 of 1.js, I implemented a showDate function that, 
when the user clicks on the quote at the top of my website, the quote 
will be replaced with the current date and will be displayed in red.
2. In 3.js, I implemented a notification function that, 
upon clicking the submit button to submit their form, the user will receive
a success message indicating that the submission was successful.
3. In lines 4 to 16 of 2.js, I implemented the pagination feature for the image gallery,
allowing users to successfully navigate through the pages by clicking the left and right 
arrows on the images. The feature utilizes the properties of modulo operation to achieve 
a looping effect.
